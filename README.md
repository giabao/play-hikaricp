# HikariCP Plugin for 2.3.x

This plugin works with `2.3.x` of [PlayFramework](https://github.com/playframework/playframework). It uses version `2.2.5` of [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP).

Note, it can be made to work with Play `2.2.x` of the PlayFramework, but it requires changing the dependencies as
the current build relies on the Play `2.3.x` plugin.

## Why HikariCP?

HikariCP is supposed to be the fastest connection pool in Java land. But we did not start to use it because of speed, but because of its reliability. After suffering with connection leaks from BoneCP, we decide to implement our own database plugin to replace the default one. You can see [a discussion about database exceptions](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/play-framework/7PBnjiXkNuU) caused by BoneCP (or misconfiguration of it). Also there are numerous other discussions about people having problems related to BoneCP.

Here is how HikariCP is working for us:

## Repository

## How to Use

There are just a few steps to properly configure the plugin. Just follow the steps bellow:

### Step 1: Add dependencies

Add the following dependency to your `project/build.sbt` or `project/Build.scala`:

    "com.sandinh" %% "play-hikaricp" % "1.7.0"
    
### Step 2: ~~Disable default `dbplugin`~~ don't need from v1.7.0

Add the following line to your `conf/application.conf`:

    dbplugin=disabled

This will disable dbplugin and avoids that BoneCP creates useless connections (which in some cases can create database problems, like exhaust available connections).

### Step 3: ~~Enable HikariCP Plugin~~ don't need from v1.7.0

Add the following line to your `conf/play.plugins`:

    200:com.edulify.play.hikaricp.HikariCPPlugin
    
Due to the fact that the [Play JPA plugin](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/master/framework/src/play-java-jpa/src/main/resources/play.plugins) is assigned a priority of **400**, please make sure that you assign `com.edulify.play.hikaricp.HikariCPPlugin` a priority less than that when using datasources looked up via JNDI. Otherwise, during application startup when JPA attempts to create the `EntityManagerFactory` your datasource will not have been bound to JNDI yet. [Play documentation](http://playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/ScalaPlugins) states that connection pools should use a **200** priority.

### Step 4: Configure HikariCP

##### Using `db.default.hikaricp.file`

**This is the preferred way to configure HikariCP** because you have full access to all [properties documented here](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP#configuration-knobs-baby) and you can also have specific configuration to development, test and production modes. You can create a specific hikari properties file and configure it using `db.default.hikaricp.file` in you `conf/application.conf` file.

Per instance, if you have a `conf/production.conf` that is loaded by play in production mode, add the following line to this file:

     db.default.hikaricp.file="conf/hikaricp.prod.properties"

Of course, you need to create `conf/hikaricp.dev.properties` file.

##### Using `hikaricp.properties`

Just create a `conf/hikaricp.properties` and the plugin will read it and create DataSource. **This mode has preference over using ordinary play way** because you have fine grained access to Hikari configuration.

##### Using ordinary [Play way](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/SettingsJDBC)

The least recommended way. Configure database properties as stated in the Play docs. The table bellow shows how Play configurations are mapped to HikariCP:

Hikari                                          | Play                           | Defaults
:-----------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------|:-----------
`driverClassName`                               | `db.default.driver`            | * Must be provided
`jdbcUrl`                                       | `db.default.url`               | * Must be provided
`username`                                      | `db.default.user`              | * Must be provided
`password`                                      | `db.default.password`          | * Must be provided
 -                                              | `db.default.partitionSize`     | * Unused/NA
`maximumPoolSize` (partitionSize * maxPoolSize) | `db.default.maxPoolSize`       | 30
`minimumPoolSize` (partitionSize * minPoolSize) | `db.default.minPoolSize`       | 5
`maxLifetime`                                   | `db.default.maxConnectionAge`  | 30 min.
`idleTimeout`                                   | `db.default.idleMaxAge`<br>`db.default.idleMaxAgeInMinutes`<br>`db.default.idleMaxAgeInSeconds`        | 10 min.
`connectionTimeout`                             | `db.default.connectionTimeout`<br>`db.default.connectionTimeoutInMs`   | 30 sec.
`leakDetectionThreshold`                        | `db.default.closeConnectionWatchTimeout`<br>`db.default.closeConnectionWatchTimeoutInMs`    | 0 ms
`connectionInitSql`                             | `db.default.initSQL`           | -
`connectionTestQuery`                           | `db.default.connectionTestStatement`           | -
`autoCommit`                                    | `db.default.defaultAutoCommit` | `true`
`transactionIsolation`                          | `db.default.defaultTransactionIsolation`  | -
`readOnly`                                      | `db.default.defaultReadOnly`   | `false`
`catalog`                                       | `db.default.defaultCatalog   ` | -
`registerMbeans`                                | `db.default.statisticsEnabled` | `false`

## JNDI Support

Thanks to community contribution, the plugin supports to bind a DataSource to a JNDI context. After properly configuring the plugin (as described above), just add the following configuration in you `application.conf`:

     db.default.jndiName="DefaultDataSource"

## Deploying to Heroku

When using Heroku, you need to [read database url string](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#connecting-in-java) from an environment variable called `DATABASE_URL`. Plain java Properties does not offer a way to reference these environment variables in a properties file, then we use [Commons Configuration](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration/) to read the `hikaricp.properties` file or the one configured by `db.default.hikaricp.file`.

Here is an example:

```
jdbcUrl=${env:DATABASE_URL}
driverClassName=org.postgresql.Driver

connectionTestQuery=SELECT 1
registerMbeans=true

# 15 minutes
maxLifetime=900000
# 5 minutes
idleTimeout=300000

maximumPoolSize=20
minimumIdle=5
```

## Inspirations and Alternatives

The code here is highly inspired by the following plugins:

1. [swaldman/c3p0-play](https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0-play)
2. [autma/play-hikaricp-plugin](https://github.com/autma/play-hikaricp-plugin)

We decide to do our own because both plugins above looks unmaintained.

There are also two other alternatives using c3p0:

1. [hadashi/play2-c3p0-plugin](https://github.com/hadashi/play2-c3p0-plugin)
2. [Furyu/play-c3p0-plugin](https://github.com/Furyu/play-c3p0-plugin)
